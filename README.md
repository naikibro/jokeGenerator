# About the Joke generator

I once heard during a job interview that one's Github contributions could tell a lot about the 0x programmer you are  
I started to feel bad as mine wasn't as full as humanly possible

### That is when i remembered the `#1 rule of programmers`:

> If you can dream it, you can make a shitty version of it in Javascript !

To never be rejected during a tech job interview, recite the following curse:

- The Internet will never see a world without my commits
- My commits do not define my value as a human ( but as a programmer, they do !)
- I will commit to this repo till im bored of buying lambos
